# Get-Random-Image-JS-API
A Simple website using Javascript and Unsplash's API to pull a Random Image of London whenever the button is pressed.
The .js Files and .CSS files are just seperate to show Github that I do have more than just HTML in this project.
The index.html file does have everything in there, so if you want to see the code in its entirety, just look at that file and ignore the .js and .css files.
